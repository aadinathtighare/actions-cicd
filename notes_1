on:
  workflow_dispatch:

  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

--> This means:

GitHub supports multiple events/ triggers under on:.
The workflow will run
✔ When a Pull Request is created/updated
✔ When someone manually clicks “Run workflow”
==================================================================

Q. Can we define both pull_request and workflow_dispatch in same workflow?
-->
Yes. GitHub Actions supports multiple triggers under the on keyword. A workflow can be triggered automatically on pull requests and also manually using workflow_dispatch.
============================================================================================
Q. workflow_dispatch trigger is use for what in GitHub Actions ?
--> Instead of triggering automatically on:

push

pull_request

schedule

workflow_dispatch allows:

👉 Manual trigger
👉 Button click execution
=========================================================================
Where Do You See It?

In GitHub:

Go to Actions tab

Select workflow

Click "Run workflow"

Provide inputs (if defined)
=======================================
Q. What Is a Reusable Workflow? 	
--> A Reusable Workflow is a workflow file that can be called by another workflow.

Reusable Workflow is an advanced GitHub Actions concept used heavily in enterprise CI/CD.
Instead of duplicating pipeline logic in multiple files, you:

Write the workflow once

Call it from different workflows

Pass different inputs

👉 Like a function in programming
======================================================
uses: repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main 
Q. why we use above ?

Using a tag (Recommended in production) -->
uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@v1.2.0
--> It means:

Call (reuse) a workflow file from a repository and execute it.

Instead of writing deployment logic again, we reuse an existing workflow.
===============================================================================
Reusable workflow (deploy.yml) & Caller workflow:
===================================================================
🔥 Where Is with: Used?
with: is used in two cases:
✅ Case 1: When Using an Action
- uses: actions/setup-node@v3
  with:
    node-version: 18
=================================================================
✅ Case 2: When Calling Reusable Workflow
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    with:
      ENV: DEV
===================================================================
🔄 Real Enterprise Flow
Step 1: Manual trigger
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      ENV:
        required: true
==================================
Step 2: Call reusable workflow
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: company/repo/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    with:
      ENV: ${{ github.event.inputs.ENV }}
==========================================
👉 Here:

workflow_dispatch collects input

with: passes input to reusable workflow

🔥 This is exactly what your screenshot pipeline is doing.
